														<p>ETSIM provides two different games that allow players to get a better understanding on different aspects of the Energy Market.</p>
														<h3 id="lien11">1.1 Market game</h3>
														<p>The Market game focuses on the SPOT Market where each player has to manage a panel of five different power plants with unique characteristics in terms of:
														<li>Type</li>
														<li>Capacity</li>
														<li>Variable costs</li>
														<li>Fixed costs</li>
														This game simulates a day in a country where demand (in terms of MW) changes at each round.
														Each round corresponds to an hour.
														Players have to make different bids (volume and price) in order to respond to the demand of the
														market. The aim for the player is to meet market’s demand in order to make profit.</p>
														<h3 id="lien12">1.2 Complete game</h3>
														<p>The Complete game focuses on long term investment and on combustible prices. In this game, players have to build new power plants in order to meet demand. Each round corresponds to a whole year.</p>
														<h3 id="lien13">1.3 User profiles</h3>
														<p>Three roles (or profiles) exist in ETSIM:

														<h2 id="lien4">4 The Market game</h2>
														<h3 id="lien41">4.1 Presentation of the game and aim</h3>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >The market game, or SPOT game, simulates the SPOT market on the energy market. Several players who each own five power plants try to sell their production in order to make profits by meeting
														the market’s demand.A round corresponds to the demand at one time of the day and thus increases or decreases during the game and the players must adapt their strategy.</p>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >Power plants have different characterisitcs that the players must take into account. The two most important are the Variable costs and the Fixed costs.Fixed costs will be charged to the player at the end of each round even if he chose not to produce
														with his plant. Fixed costs are expenses that are not dependent on the level of production.Variable costs, expressed in €/MWh are only charged to the player if he succeeded to sell his production. It mostly corresponds to the cost of the combustible.
														The SPOT game uses a market analysis algorithm that gathers all bids and sort them in increasing order of price. Once the aggregate bids meet the volume market’s demand, the SPOT price is determined as the last (which means the highest) price that met the market’s demand.
														This means that every bids that were accepted will be payed at the SPOT price. Bids that were rejected will not get anything.</p>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >The following graph shows how the algorithm works. In red is displayed the bids made by the Players sorted in increasing order.In blue is displayed the Demand. Offers that are accepted are located on the left side of the blue curve.
														Offers that are rejected are placed on the right side of the blue curve.</p>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >You can also note that the last accepted offer is the same line than the demand value. It means that this offer will not be accpeted in totality.</p>
														<span class="image featured"><img src="images/displayedResults.JPG" alt="" /></span>
														<p>Figure 4.1: Displayed results</p>
														<h3 id="lien42">4.2 How to play</h3>
														<p>As explained, the aim for the player is to meet the market’s demand by selling its production in order to make profits. To do so, he has to place bids that will be function of the power plants the Players owns and of the demand.</p>
														<h1 id="lien421">4.2.1 Power plants</h1>
														<p>The table below shows the list of power plants owned by the Player. It shows:
														<li>The name of the plant</li>
														<li>Power: Production capacity of the plant in MW</li>
														<li>Type of plant</li>
														<li>Variable costs in €/MWh</li>
														<li>Fixed cost in euros that will be charged to the player even if he does not place a bid for this plant</li></p>

														<h1 id="lien422">4.2.2 Bids</h1>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >As explained, the Player has to place bids, in terms of Volume and Price, to meet the market’s demand. The demand, expressed in MW is displayed for each round and corresponds to a certain percentage of the installed capacity.
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >To make a bid, the Player has to select the corresponding plant and make an offer in terms of volume and price.</p>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >It is possible to make different offers for a same plant. In that case, fixed costs are only charged once.</p>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >Bids can not exceed 180€/MW.</p>
														<p style="text-align:justify;" >To add a new offer, click on new one.</p>
